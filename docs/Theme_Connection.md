# Connection to the Themes

**Theme: Learning, Skills & Opportunity**

Path-finder is a web-application designed to help SAS students discover and select school activities that align with their interests. Built with a modern stack (React, Node.js, Django REST Framework, and MUI), the project **goes beyond** a simple directory of clubs; it is an intentional learning and decision-support tool that connects directly to “Learning, Skills & Opportunity.”

First, Path-finder expands access to learning by surfacing a **broader range** of activities than students typically encounter through informal networks or word of mouth. By centralizing opportunities—from clubs to competitions and enrichment programs—and making them **searchable** and **filterable**, it lowers the barrier to entry for students who may be unsure where to start or who do not already have strong connections to existing groups.

Second, the project explicitly supports skills development. All the clubs and activities listed in Path-finder build competencies that are difficult to cultivate solely through classroom learning: collaboration, leadership, creativity, and resilience skills in areas like coding, design, debate, or service. By helping students match their interests with these opportunities, Path-finder nudges them toward experiences that deepen both academic and extracurricular skill sets.

Third, Path-finder is itself a learning vehicle for its creators. Implementing AI agents, a RESTful backend, and a modern frontend interface requires integrating knowledge of software engineering, user experience, and data modelling. This end-to-end system demonstrates practical skills in full-stack development, API design, and product thinking—capabilities directly transferable to future study and work.

Finally, by making opportunities more visible and personalized, Path-finder promotes equity of opportunity. Students who might otherwise overlook or feel excluded from certain activities receive tailored suggestions based on their interests rather than existing social circles. In this sense, the project functions as a small but meaningful infrastructure for widening participation in rich learning experiences, embodying the core theme of “Learning, Skills & Opportunity” both in what it offers to its users and in what it demands from its developers.
